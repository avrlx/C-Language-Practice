# Learning C Programming ðŸš€

This repository contains my practice programs, mini-projects, and notes as I learn C programming â€” from basics to advanced topics.

## Goals

- Learn pointers, memory management, and data structures
- Build small C projects (calculator, file handler, etc.)
- Document concepts for easy revision

/control_flow/ â€” if, switch, loops  
/functions/ â€” Functions and recursion  
/arrays_strings/ â€” Arrays, strings  
/pointers/ â€” Pointer examples  
/structures/ â€” Structures and unions  
/file_handling/ â€” File read/write  
/projects/ â€” Mini-projects  
/notes/ â€” Notes and explanations  

## Requirements
