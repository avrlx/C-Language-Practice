# Learning C Programming 🚀

This repository contains my practice programs, mini-projects, and notes as I learn C programming — from basics to advanced topics.

## Goals

- Understand C syntax, data types, and control structures
- Learn pointers, memory management, and data structures
- Build small C projects (calculator, file handler, etc.)
- Document concepts for easy revision

## Project Structure

/basics/ — Basic syntax, input/output  
/control_flow/ — if, switch, loops  
/functions/ — Functions and recursion  
/arrays_strings/ — Arrays, strings  
/pointers/ — Pointer examples  
/structures/ — Structures and unions  
/file_handling/ — File read/write  
/projects/ — Mini-projects  
/notes/ — Notes and explanations  

## How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g. gcc).

To compile:
gcc path/to/your_program.c -o your_program

To run:

./your_program

Example:

gcc basics/hello_world.c -o hello ./hello

## Requirements

- GCC compiler
- Terminal / command prompt access
- (Optional) Code editor or IDE (VSCode, Code::Blocks)

## License

Open for learning and educational use.
